Writing in assembler or 'C' to run a few timers, debounce inputs and flash a few lights is not a sensible use of either Python or a Raspberry Pi when a single chip like a PIC can be lashed onto a scrap of Veroboard for a couple of pounds.\n\n\nI'm not against any of these products, but there are places where they simply aren't appropriate, but that doesn't stop people with a one track mind doing it anyway.
